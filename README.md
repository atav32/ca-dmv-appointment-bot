# DMV Appointment Bot
This bot will constantly re-check for new appointments at a specific DMV office. If an appointment opens up for the date you want, then it books the appointment for you.

## Problem
Appointments at the DMV in California can be booked out months in advance. For example, on August 17, 2017 the earliest appointment for my local DMV office was October 19, 2017 (2+ months!). What if I want to go next week? Or maybe tomorrow? Python-script-powered-by-`selenium`-and-`BeautifulSoup` to the rescue!

## Solution
Anyone can cancel a DMV appointment anytime without any retribution so it's easy to assume that slots open up a lot. This script constantly checks for DMV appointments, and if there's an opening for the set date, then it books the appointment.

## Requirements

* Python 3+
* bs4
* selenium
* PhantomJS (optional)

## Setup and Install

* `$ git clone github://jappareti`
* `$ cd dmv_appointment_scheduler` 
* `$ virtualenv env`
* `$ source env/bin/activate`
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `$ python book_dmv.py` with arguments
* Wait for an appointment to open up.

## Notes
This script only checks for **exact dates**. Yes it's possible to set it up so that it's smarter (e.g within the next two weeks) but why not be pickier? The first time I ran it, it booked an appointment within 2 mins for a date only 4 days away, but YMMV!

If you don't want to use PhantomJS, then you can change `br = webdriver.PhantomJS()` to `br = webdriver.Firefox()`
